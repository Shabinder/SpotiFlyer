### Todos 📄
 - Write **Tests**.
 - Support for Podcasts/Episodes and Shows.
 - Build a Media Player into this app. [#113](https://github.com/Shabinder/SpotiFlyer/issues/113) 
 
### Note
The availability of YouTube Music / JioSaavn in your country is important for this app to work. The reason behind this is, we use YouTube Music / JioSaavn to filter out our search results and get the desired song downloaded from Youtube Music OR other providers we may use(like Jio Saavn).
To check if YouTube Music is available in your country, visit [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com).

I am hosting a **server for WEB APP on my own personal device** , so expect some downtimes, If you have a **server** available and would like to share , open an issue or ping me wherever you can get a hold of me.


### Permissions Info:
 - **NETWORK**- *(INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, ACCESS_WIFI_STATE)*: to access the online streaming services, and Confirm Network Connectivity.
 - **STORAGE**- *READ_STORAGE_PERMISSION, READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)*: to save Downloaded Media Files.
 - **QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES**- in order to check if Youtube Music, Spotify, Gaana, JioSaavn, etc apps are installed and if they are, user can directly open them.
 - **REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS**: User Allows App to Run in Background at runtime in Permission Dialog.
 - **Wake Lock**: Don't let Wifi/Internet Sleep in screen off / dozing state when Songs are being downloaded.
 - **Foreground Service**: Service responsible to download and save songs to storage even after app is exited/background. 
 - **NOTE**: Analytics and Crashlytics are **OPT-IN** *(Disabled by Default)* and are **Self-Hosted**.
